NB. Testing simulation for schools
NB. Comparison between Blue and Red school given actual disease prevalence.
NB.
NB.
NB. School Blue: 1000 children, 7 are sick (low prevalence)
NB. School Red : 800 children, 48 are sick (high prevalence)
NB.
NB. What are the results of mass testing assuming a test gives positive
NB. 95% of the times that a child is sick and gives negative 99.8% of the times
NB. that a child is not sick? The sensitivity of 95% and the specificity of 99.8%
NB. are based on actual values of the WHO's PCR assay released for COVID19
NB.
NB.
NB. Examples:
NB. simulate red         -- runs a test on all 'schoolchildren' of school red and returns the result for each candidate
NB.    	     		    in a matrix with true positives, false negatives, true negatives and false positives
NB. psim red		 -- returns the totals in a boxed frame
NB. 1001 ltest blue      -- runs a simulation of 1001 schools of the blue typ e(low prevalence)

NB. > 1001 ltest blue

NB. ------------------- experiments

NB. What are the results you can expect when testing 5000 schools of the 'red' kind?
NB. Run 5000 ltest red

bigarray=. bigarray, simulate school
times=. times -1
