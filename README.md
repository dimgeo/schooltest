# schooltest
Crude simulation of COVID19 mass testing at schools given disease prevalence

Use examples like: 

School Blue: 1000 children, 7 are sick (low prevalence)

School Red : 800 children, 48 are sick (high prevalence)

What are the results of mass testing assuming a test gives positive
95% of the times that a child is sick and gives negative 99.8% of the times
that a child is not sick? The sensitivity of 95% and the specificity of 99.8%
are based on actual values of the WHO's PCR assay released for COVID19


Examples:

simulate red         -- runs a test on all 'schoolchildren' of school red and returns the result for each candidate
          	    in a matrix with true positives, false negatives, true negatives and false positives
                                            
psim red	        	 -- returns the totals in a boxed frame

1001 ltest blue      -- runs a simulation of 1001 schools of the blue type (low prevalence)
